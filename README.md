# MS17-010_explained
Oveview: 
These Powerpoint slides correspond with MS17-010_Analyzed.py and provide both a high overview of MS17-010, as well as an indepth technical analysis. I included a slide explaining the SMB protocol for context, then explanaitions of the three bugs, pseudo code of Window's vulnerable source code, the chain of events and lastly, my breakdown of the Python exploit sourcecode and how it sequentially, exploits each of the three bugs.

The code sequence slides are mine, the other illustrations were taken from
